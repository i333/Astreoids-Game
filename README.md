Astreoids Game with Objective-C

Classic Astreoids game recreated for iPhone. User can move the spaceship using the controllers on the lower left and right side of the screen. 
We tried to recreate the retro look of old astreoid game as much as possible, that's why we refrained from slide allowing joystick and made the control mechanisms primitive similar to the original game.
